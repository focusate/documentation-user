=====================
History of Activities
=====================

Save done and cancelled activities in history table for later analysis.

Configuration
=============

For these features to work, module :code:`mail_activity_history` must be
installed.

.. note::
    In multi-company environment, module
    :code:`mail_activity_history_multicompany` should be installed, so
    users could access only global or user's company history.

Log Cancelled Activity
======================

Optionally, it might be configured to log cancelled activities in the
chatter, just like done activities. To activate this feature,
*Log Cancelled Activities* in Discuss section of General Settings must
be enabled.

With this option enabled, cancelled activity will not disappear (as in
standard Odoo behavior) and will be logged in the chatter.
